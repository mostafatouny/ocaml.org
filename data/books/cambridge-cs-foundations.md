These notes teach programming, and present some fundamental principles of computer science, especially algorithm design. A reader may have some experience in programming. The programming in this course is based on the language OCaml and mostly concerns the functional programming style. Functional programs tend to be shorter and easier to understand than their counterparts in conventional languages such as C. In the space of a few weeks, we shall cover many fundamental data structures and learn basic methods for estimating efficiency.
